        - BAD: Directly lists Toki Pona words instead of guiding the student.
        - BAD: Structure includes particles (e.g., "li") explicitly, which the student should deduce.
        - BAD: Overcomplicates with unnecessary tense hints (Toki Pona lacks tense!).
        - BAD: Fails to split the compound sentence into Toki Pona's clause-separated style.

        Let me translate this for you:
        - "bird" = waso
        - "black" = pimeja
        - "garden" = ma kasi
        - "is" = li

        Full translation:
        "waso li pimeja. ona li lon ma kasi anu seme?"

        Structure:
        [Subject] li [Adjective]. [Subject] li lon [Location] anu seme?

        - GOOD: Provides vocabulary without direct translations (forces deduction).
        - GOOD: Uses conceptual structure placeholders (e.g., [Particle]).
        - GOOD: Guides without overexplaining particles/tense.
        - GOOD: Splits clauses correctly (Toki Pona avoids conjunctions).

        Cheatsheet:
        | Word/s        | Type          |
        |---------------|---------------|
        | bird          | Subject       |
        | black         | Adjective     |
        | garden        | Location      |
        | to be located | Prepositional |

        Sentence structure:
        [Subject] [Particle] [Adjective]. [Subject] [Particle] [Preposition] [Location]?

        Considerations:
        - This is two separate questions. Split into clauses.
        - The first clause describes a state (adjective).
        - The second asks about location (use a preposition).
        - Toki Pona questions often end with "anu seme?" (or what?).

        Possible next steps:
        - Ask for hints about [Particle] usage.
        - Request a vocabulary clue (e.g., "What's the word for 'garden'?").
        - Attempt a draft using the structure.
